# Analyzing-Performance-Variability-in-Alibaba-s-Microservice-Architecture
ICPE 2024 - Data Challenge
In the vast and complex microservice architectures used by companies like Alibaba, pinpointing and resolving performance bottlenecks presents a substantial challenge due to the intricate web of interactions among thousands of services. To tackle this issue, we've developed a method centered around the concept of a critical path to analyze the interactions between microservices in these intricate systems. This method helps in identifying the critical paths where service requests encounter the most significant delays. Our key contribution is the identification of variability in the response times of service interactions along these critical paths, highlighting specific interactions that exhibit a high level of performance variability. This advancement enhances the detection of system performance problems, enables the dynamic refinement of data collection granularity, and focuses on critical interactions for adaptive tracing.
